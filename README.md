# NetworkLift

## Version
**_3.5.1_**

## Objectives
  - Write a script that fetches 10 RECENT Instagram image URLs from a given tag.
  - For those 10 images, I'm going to filter out images that contain the words; kik, click, or push.
  - Check the caption of the image and the bio text of the user who posted the image.
  - If any of those three words are detected skip them, otherwise save/print them. _(Use the user ID or image itself to load and get the user bio text etc.)_
  - Also, to parse the number of followers and followings the user who posted the image has, and save/print that out too.
  - After finishing the task above, make one small change by adding more than three tags with the previous tag and print three images out randomly in the end.
